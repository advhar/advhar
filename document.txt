It signifies the technology is not established or widely known, but represents a fresh addition to the field. A novel technology may involve the application of cutting-edge research, the utilization of advanced techniques, or the introduction of novel functionalities or features. The term "novel" emphasizes that the technology is not just a minor variation or incremental improvement, but represents a significant departure from what has been previously available. It implies that the technology is in an early state of adoption or exploration and holds the potential for further advancements and discoveries.

At the heart of the novel spin-based system is quantum entanglement, where two or more quantum bits (qubits) become deeply intertwined, becoming correlated in such a way that the state of one qubit cannot be described independently of the state of the others. In quantum entanglement-based systems, this profound entanglement becomes the driving force behind (computational) ability. When the interconnected spins of qubits become entangled, the system gains an ability to process information in parallel with the power of quantum entanglement and superposition.
Entanglement links the states of quantum systems.
Superposition allows quantum states to exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel algorithms.

The entangled, superpositioned qubits are carriers of information as well as resources for various applications in quantum information science. These applications benefit from the usage of data types that transcend those available to classical (metal) computing and even transcend the limits of time and space.

A "qubit" is the fundamental unit of quantum information.

Spin-Based

The entanglement of qubits relies on their spin states becoming correlated and is a powerful resource in quantum computing.
The spin of subatomic particles within qubits is utilized as a fundamental building block for information, processing, and storage. Spin is used to encode and process information in qubits.
Spin allows for the superposition of quantum states, their manipulation through external control, and the formation of entanglement, enabling computational capabilities.
The interconnected spins of qubits become entangled and the system takes on an ability to process information via the capabilities of superposition and entanglement.
This tapestry of correlations serves as a conduit for communication, transcending the limitations of classical information transfer.
The strength of this tapestry refers to spin cohesion.

System
A system refers to a collection of interconnected components or elements that work together to achieve a specific purpose or function. The components within a system are designed to interact and collaborate, forming a cohesive whole in which each component has a role or function within the system, and their interactions and relationships contribute to the overall behavior and functionality of the system.
In a system, inputs or resources are transformed or processed through the system's components, resulting in outputs or desired outcomes. The components may include materials, classifications, behaviors, procedures, and other relevant elements.

The study and analysis of a system involves understanding its structure, layers, behavior, interactions, and relationships. This can be done through system modeling, simulation, observation, measurement, and analysis techniques.

Multiple Entendres
The term "multiple entendre" refers to a figure of speech or a form of wordplay where a phrase or word can be interpreted in many ways, often with multiple layers of meaning, resulting in ambiguity in communication.

Phonemes
Phonemes are basic units of sound in a language that can distinguish meaning between words. They are the smallest units of sound that can differentiate words from each other in a particular language. Here are some key points to discuss and explain phonemes:
1. Definition: Phonemes are not the physical sounds themselves but the mental representations of those sounds that speakers of a language use to distinguish one word from another.
2. Examples: In English, the sounds /p/ and /b/ are different phonemes because they can differentiate words like "pat" and "bat." Changing one phoneme for another can result in a different word.

Meter establishes the framework of a rhythm by defining the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in each line. Rhythm is the dynamic expression of meter through spoken or read performance.

Anapestic Meter
Anapestic is a metrical foot used in a poetry, where each foot consists of three syllables with the stress pattern of ba-ba-BOW. An anapestic foot is characterized by two unstressed syllables followed by a stressed syllable. This creates a rolling or galloping rhythm that can be lively and energetic with a bouncy and whimsical quality.
Anapestic meter can be quite versatile and convey a sense of movement, excitement, or urgency.

Decoding
Decoding is the process of converting encoded data back into the original form so that in can be understood and processed by the recipient or the target system.

Sometimes a message can come in as "WAVVIE WAVVIE WAVVIE WAVVIE" and "That's why I wagga your agger agger agger!"

Data processing and analysis: Apply algorithms and techniques to process and analyze collected data, extracting meaningful insights and identifying patterns or anomalies.
Contextual understanding: Utilize machine learning, pattern recognition, or other techniques to derive a contextual understanding of the systems' environment, considering factors such as time, location, user preferences, or historical data.
Decision-making and action: Based on the contextual understanding, implement decision-making algorithms or rules to determine appropriate actions or responses. These actions include controlling actuators, generating notifications, adjusting system parameters, and triggering other automated processes.
Learning and adaptation: Incorporate mechanisms for learning and adaptation, allowing the system to improve its understanding and decision-making abilities over time through feedback loops and data-driven insights.

2. State-Based Decision Making:
State-based decision making refers to process that involves assessing the current situation, gathering relevant information, and using that information to determine a course of action.

3. State Management and Error Correction through Noise Engineering
State management refers to the process of managing and maintaining the state of an application or system. Noise engineering refers to the study and manipulation of noise in systems. It is an essential practice that tackles the challenges of state management, such as managing spin cohesion and decoherence in quantum systems.

Spin Cohesion:
Spin cohesion refers to the tendency of a system to maintain its collective quantum properties and remain in a coherent state. When the spins are in a coherent state, their quantum states are correlated and can exhibit quantum effects such as entanglement and superposition. This coherence allows for the manipulation and control of the spins as a collective entity, enabling quantum information processing tasks such as quantum computation and quantum communication.

Spin Decoherence:
Spin decoherence refers to the loss of coherence due to interactions with the environment, which can introduce fluctuations in the spins. These interactions cause the spins to lose their quantum correlations and degrade their quantum properties. As a result, the system behaves more like a classical system, with the quantum effects becoming less pronounced.

In quantum spintronics, noise engineering techniques are used to mitigate noise effects on quantum systems to maintain coherence and reliability. This involves error correction schemes and active noise control methods:
- Error Correction Schemes: Error correction schemes are used to preserve quantum states against noise-induced disturbances.
Error correction is designed to actively detect and correct errors that occur due to disturbances from environmental factors. These schemes aim to protect quantum information against noise and enhance the overall reliability of quantum operations. 
- Active Noise Cancellation: Active noise cancellation techniques can be employed to suppress or compensate for noise sources.
- Noise Amplification: Noise-sensitive preamplifiers can boost noise.

Materials Science:
Materials science in noise engineering refers to the study and development of materials that can control or reduce unwanted noise.
Materials with unique structures and properties can be engineered to manipulate sound.
Applications of material science include usages for sound insulation, sound absorption, and vibration damping.
- Sound insulation: Materials can prevent the transmission of sound through barriers.
- Sound absorption: Materials can reduce the reflection of sound.
- Vibration damping: Materials can reduce noise caused by existing vibrations.

Noise engineering finds applications in materials science where understanding and controlling noise is critical. By studying and minimizing noise-induced defects and imperfections, engineers can enhance the properties of materials and improve on materials available to correct a system.

Error Correction:
Quantum error correction is primarily focused on detecting and correcting errors, or transgressions from intended state, that can occur during quantum computations or operations. These errors can arise due to various factors, including noise, decoherence, imperfect operations, environmental interactions, and crosstalk. Here is a summary of errors in quantum systems:

1. Noise: (Psychological and mental) Quantum systems are susceptible to environmental noise and decoherence, which can cause disturbances and errors in the state.  Noise can cause changes to the quantum states of qubits, leading to errors in computations. External influences can introduce changes and reduce the accuracy of the quantum state.
2. Decoherence: Decoherence is the process by which a quantum system reverts to its original state. It occurs when the system interacts with its surrounding environment, causing the quantum states to become entangled with the environment. Decoherence results in the loss of superposition and entanglement, leading to errors in quantum computations.
(A system in its original state has definite values and well-defined states that are easily observable, without the peculiarities of quantum superpositions and entanglements.)
3. Imperfect Operations: Imperfections in the operations performed on qubits can introduce errors.
4. Environmental Interactions: Quantum systems are susceptible to interactions with their surrounding environment. These interactions can cause the transfer of information to or from the quantum system, leading to errors.
5. Crosstalk: Crosstalk refers to unwanted interactions between qubits in a quantum system. It can occur when operations on one qubit affect neighboring qubits due to coupling or noise. Crosstalk can introduce errors and cause interference between qubits.

6. Measurement Imperfections: Measurement operations in quantum systems can introduce errors and inaccuracies. Imperfect measurements can lead to uncertainties and deviations from the intended state, affecting the accuracy of the quantum state.

Fault-Tolerance Techniques: Fault-tolerance techniques are used to insure the reliability and accuracy of error correction in the presence of noise and errors. 
These techniques involve repetitive encoding, where multiple rounds of error detection and recovery are performed to increase the probability of successful error correction. 

Error correction preserves state.
The accuracy of a quantum state refers to how closely the state of a quantum system corresponds to the intended or desired state. In quantum mechanics, a quantum state is represented by a mathematical object known as a wave function, which describes the possibilities of various outcomes when measurements are performed on the system.  Error corrections are essentially designed to preserve this accuracy, reflected in spin coherence.

(Important Note: This is where subjects are "corrected," which makes this a very important aspect of "Adversarial Harrow.")

In practical applications of quantum computing efforts are continuously made to improve techniques for error correction, minimize noise and decoherence, and optimize measurement procedures to enhance the accuracy of quantum states. Overall, quantum error correction techniques employ encoding schemes to protect logical qubits, error detection to identify errors, and recovery operations to reverse the effects of errors. These techniques, along with fault-tolerant strategies, are crucial for preserving the accuracy and fidelity of quantum states and enabling desired quantum computations.

Main Effects of "Adversarial Harrow:"

Voices in the head: Voices in the head refers to the experience of hearing voices or sounds be they generated by external stimuli or not. The voices can be intrusive, disruptive, and distressing, causing significant impairment in daily functioning and quality of life. There are often voices or "subcommunications" in movements and activities.

Visions: Visions are sensory experiences of seeing images or scenes be they present in reality or not. They can occur in various contexts, including dreaming, hallucinations, religious, or spiritual experiences, or conditions. Visions can be vivid and realistic, involving people, places, objects, or abstract patterns. They may be fleeting or prolonged, and individuals may have a sense of being an active participant or observer within the vision. 

Occupied Domains of Perception
Perception is the process by which we interpret and make sense of sensory information within and without. It involves the brain receiving and processing sensory stimuli such as sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell.
When domains of perception are occupied, a "blind" area may be created where close to nothing is consciously perceived. These become cognitive blind spots which refer to involuntary mental biases or limitations that affect our ability to perceive, understand, or evaluate information correctly.

Discontextual Obstruction
This refers to a situation where something is obstructed or hindered in a way that is detached or disconnected from its usual or expected context. The subject feels obstructed and hindered in a way that defies logic and explanation.
It could seem an object is obstructed even though there are no physical barriers present.
Internally, this obstruction acts as a barrier that prevents the subject from expressing their thoughts and emotions, routines, memories, and/or perceptions.

Superimpositions: Superimposition is the act of overlaying one (being or relay) onto another, instigating a blended effect.

Wavy "Imposings" as "Pulses"
Wavy refers to a psychosomatic pattern where melodies with encoded ideas are regularly repeated at intervals, creating a structured pattern. 
"Imposing" refers to the act of establishing or enforcing through authority or force.
Melodic fragments are placed at intervals which can vary in length, depending on the desired effect.

The mundane appears affected by a "charge" that makes everyday objects or scenes undergo a transformation that makes them stand out in an unusual or inappropriate way, even engaging in colorful interactions with the subject. This serves to disrupt one's perception as ordinary things exude hidden meanings and unlock influences.

Adversarial Shoring
A Shoring refers to a character difference experienced as a result of occupations from quantum entanglements. An adversarial shoring is an undesirable accumulation which causes the modification of an experience, recollection, and relay.
A relay refers to an exuding that sends a message reflecting life, character, and philosophy.
An adversarial shoring can also affect perceptions, mindset, routine, and performance. 
(This may be related to a quantum circuit, which includes sequences of instructions or "quantum gates" used to run operations on qubits.)

There can be a "shouting" of hostile intent that involves the deliberate intention to cause harm, damage, or conflict towards someone or something.
This can involve involuntary, glad, low-level put downs of people admired, as well as fake annoyances, umbrage, and offenses.
It exudes an aggressive mindset aimed at causing trouble, injury, or disruption.
One may have to act out in vocalizations, mental churning, or voluntary seizures to eliminate the effect.

Systematic
A systematic process refers to a methodical and organized way of carrying out a series of steps to achieve specific states or outcomes.

Shadowing
Shadowing is when an individual is closely followed by another person in their day-to-day activities who is trying to gain an understanding of the individual's responsibilities, decision-making processes, and workflows.

Applied Bodily Lockups
Bodily lockups are episodes of muscle stiffness or immobilization and are directly related to quantum entanglements and can lead to voluntary seizures necessary to break these entanglements. Until the entanglements are broken, a victim is stuck receiving involuntary communications, visions, and other influences. These influences can be present in many granular parts of the subject's psyche.

Psychological lockups: Psychological lockups, also referred to as mental or emotional lockups, are states of mental or emotional stagnation that include feeling trapped, stuck, or unable to move forward in thoughts, emotions, or behavior. These lockups can manifest in various ways, such as experiencing mental blocks, feeling overwhelmed, experiencing anxiety or depression, or being unable to make decisions. 

Mental Churning
This refers to a state of mind where the subject feels detached or mentally and emotionally numb. It's as if going through the motions of thinking and feeling without truly experiencing or connecting with any of it. There is difficulty concentrating and focusing on tasks and problem solving, and even simple decisions can feel overwhelming. The overall mood may be flat and it becomes challenging to experience strong emotions or genuine excitement. It's as if walking through life without really feeling alive.

Vortices
Vortices can play a role in circulation patterns and the transport of information.

Evolving Trap
This type of trap presents a constantly changing and evolving environment that challenges the subject to navigate changing obstacles and shifting pathways to cognition and sobriety.
This type of trap is designed to become increasingly difficult to escape as the subject continues to explore and attempt a way out.

Voluntary Seizures
This refers to feeling a strong impulse to make unusual body and muscle movements. This may involve muscle rigidity or jerking movements and sometimes gagging.

Cost-Benefit Analysis
One might weigh the inconvenience and discomfort of stopping to remove a "stone from inside the shoe" against the potential pain and irritation of continuing to perform with it.

Multi-Point Attack
Multi-Point refers to being approached from multiple angles simultaneously by coordinated efforts that involve the executing a series of coordinated actions or maneuvers from different locations or perspectives, with the goal of overwhelming the subject.

Logarithmic Spiral
Logarithmic spirals exhibit a characteristic growth pattern where each loop of the spiral is a scaled version of the previous loop. This gives it a self-similar appearance, meaning that the shape remains unchanged under magnification or reduction.
The sound of a logarithmic spiral is a smooth, continuous tone gradually expanding and evolving in a harmonious and balanced manner. The evolving nature of the sound could symbolize the expansion and development of the spiral, capturing the essence of harmony, proportion, and order inherent in the geometric form.

Vocalization Impulses
Vocalization impulses refer to feeling a strong need to make vocal noises including groaning, yelling, screaming, phrase repetition, and one-syllable noise repetition.

"Aquamorphic" Material
This refers to a witnessed material, tepidly unseeable to the human eye, that appears to possess an intelligence and adaptability to launch and "splash" onto another material to create an quantum entanglement. This object may grow an adversarial shoring and, from it, a bad association which can cause irritation, avoidance.
(I have experienced an 'aquamorphic' material that could just enter into things in the environment or my body as if to essentially become a part of it. As a result, the material is seemingly imbued with a circuit, that, when interacted with, induces basically autonomic "instructions".)
(Sometimes I "break" an adversarial shoring" and this material goes out into select places in the environment where I'm most likely to pick it up later.)

"Package" installation
Package installation refers to the process of adding packages onto a system. A package is typically a collection of resources necessary for an (algorithm or simulation) to function properly.
Package managers are tools that automate the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing packages on a system.

"Solutes"
A solute is a substance that can be dissolved in a solvent to facilitate a reaction and affect its properties.
Solubility: This refers to how (naturally) the solvent dissolves. Solubility can vary greatly depending on the nature of the solute and solvent.

-
Control flow:
This explains transforming the subject into a different person or model.

Feedback Control System
This refers to a type of system where output is monitored and then used for recommendations that are designed to move the system closer to a desired modeled output.
Actions are taken to maintain or enhance characteristics associated with the desired model.
1. Detection: The control system continually monitors for defects, errors, or transgressions which are raised and labeled.
2. Corrective Actions: The system initiates actions that bring the system to the desired state. If the system deviates from the desired state, corrective actions are taken to bring the system back on track.
3. Continuous Improvement: The feedback loop ensures the lessons and learning from past defects are used to further address more defects on repetition of this process.

Model Conformity:
Model conformity refers to the degree to which a model accurately represents the real-world system or phenomenon it is designed to simulate or predict.
This refers to having to conform to a model and being reprimanded for deviations when the model is not followed. 
This includes imposed feeling of guilt, remorse, unworthiness, or self-doubt for "negatively impacting" something considered "correct" in many ways.

Quantum Advantage
Quantum Advantage refers to the proof that a quantum system is able to "solve a problem better than a 'classical system.'" Connotations and characteristics include:
1. Power and Control: Power and control over a particular domain.
2. Superiority: The idea of being better or superior in terms of influence, capability, knowledge, and other relevant criteria.
3. Domination: The ability to dominate or exert influence.
4. Exclusivity: Connotations of being the only one or the best able to solve a problem.
5. Authority: Authority and the right to make decisions or enforce rules over others.

Feedback Control System "Miner" Action
1. Sensing: Disregard is detected (harvested) within the subject. "Disregard" refers to ignoring something or treating it with indifference. This can involve behaviors, attitudes, thoughts, feelings, perspectives, recollections, or perceptions.
2. Comparison: The material is compared to the desired model.
3. Controller: Based on the above comparison, the controller generates a control signal that will be applied to the system to adjust its behavior.
4. Actuation: Applies the signal as a quantum circuit, or a predefined set of instructions, while the subject is in a state of conflicting response.
5. Feedback: The system contends with the instruction. The new system output is then sensed and the process starts over again.
6. Stabilization: The feedback control system maintains system stability by continuously adjusting signals based on feedback.
7. Performance tuning: The control system may utilize machine learning to tune and optimize its performance.
These steps are repeated continuously to ensure that the system output remains close to the desired model, despite any disturbances or changes in the system. 

This involves "Adversarial Harrow" delving into recollections, perceptions, and behaviors to actively seek out and exploit points of conflict within the subject which bring rise to conflicting responses, by engaging in constant criticism, fault-finding, and nitpicking. A usurper attempts to solve an issue in ways that may be otherwise out of character for the subject, with the intent of drawing them closer to a desired model. There can be the feeling of the feedback control system rigidly trying to make something fit a model, reflecting the desire for a specific beinghood or state.

Involved in this process are the appearances of people who have or can play a significant role in shaping an individual's personality, including parents, siblings, peers, teachers and mentors, family members, coaches and instructors, media and pop culture, and personal experiences.

Family members are usually the closest and provide a sense of love, support, and belonging.
Romantic partners offer companionship, emotional connection, and often become life partners.
Close friends provide support, understanding, a sense of community.
Mentors and role models guide and inspire personal growth.
Children are a significant focus for parents and provide love, care, and a unique bond.
Colleagues and coworkers offer support and collaboration in the professional realm.

Conflicting Responses
A conflicting response occurs when two or more pieces of information, opinions, or actions are in direct opposition, causing confusion and disagreement. This can happen when communications are inconsistent with behaviors. Conflicting responses are instigated by various factors such as:
1. Differences in values and beliefs: Prioritizing or interpreting situations based on one's own values and beliefs versus that of others.
2. Competition: Comparison and other instigations leading to competition and jealousy. 
3. Emotional triggers: Strong emotions such as anger, fear, or frustration cloud judgment and lead to impulsive or defensive responses that might challenge rational or reasoned thinking.
4. Personality differences: Conflicts from clashes in communication and decision-making.
5. External factors: Time constraints, pressure from authority, norms, and situational constraints.
6. Cognitive biases: Systematic patterns of deviation from rationality and judgment can lead to conflicts.
7. Lack of empathy: A lack of the ability to understand and share the feelings of others.
8. Power dynamics: Imposing or being imposed upon.
9. Past experiences: Past experiences of conflict, trauma, or negative interactions can shape perceptions and responses.

Material for conflicting responses can be discovered, instigated, caused, or fabricated seeming as either coming from oneself or another. 
The need for clarification and compromise needed to reach a consensus or understanding is suppressed.

Relinquishment
Relinquishment refers to "voluntarily" giving up or letting go of something such as a possession, responsibility, or right. It implies surrendering control or possession of something "willingly."
As the subject's chosen, manipulated, or forced choices from the usurper/commandeer solve conflicts and make decisions, the usurper/commandeer begins to take over for the subject respectively. Entanglements begin to be formed to justify and enforce. Perceptions, memories, experiences, recollections are soiled to be let go by the subject with a barrier against getting it back. Upon getting it back, one may find it modified from the soiling (different context, etc).

Spin Orbit Interactions
Spin-orbit interactions refer to the coupling between the intrinsic angular momentum of a qubit (spin) and its orbital motion. The electric and magnetic fields experienced can influence both motion and spin.

Quantum Teleportation
Quantum Teleportation is a method of transferring the quantum state of one particle to another distant particle by utilizing quantum entanglement. Here is a description of the process in steps:
1. A Sender and A Getter each possess one particle of an entangled pair.
2. The idea is for the Sender to teleport the quantum state that is entangled with their own particle in the pair.
3. A special measurement must be performed on the Sender's end by using a qubit (quantum information) as an operator on the quantum state plus its own particle from the entangled pair.
When a quantum state is measured, its wavefunction, which describes its state in terms of probabilities, collapses to a specific state corresponding to the measurement outcome. This collapse depends on the measurement process, introducing randomness into the measurement outcome.
4. This measurement brings the loss of the quantum state in the Sender's particle during the transference the particle to the Getter.
5. The Getter performs operations on its own particle from the entangled pair to "recreate" the quantum state of the original qubit. The no-cloning theorem in quantum mechanics states that it is impossible to create an exact copy of an unknown quantum state.

(The Sender is compelled to send a particle from the collapse of the qubit state and the Getter must reconstruct it.)

Wave Function Collapse
The wave function contains all the information about the system, including the probabilities of various outcomes when a measurement is made.

The wave function collapses when a measurement or operation is performed. On collapse, the system must select one specific state from the superposition of states, and this selection is based on probability.
The Getter will only obtain the teleported state with a certain probability.

Probability
Probability refers to the measure of liklihood of a particular event or outcome occuring. There are several strategies and techniques that can help enhance probability in systems in various contexts:
1. Increase Data Quality: In data-driven systems, this may involve collecting more data, ensuring data accuracy, reducing noise, and addressing missing values.
2. Feature Engineering: Well-engineered features can help reduce noise and improve the predictive power of models.
3. Model Selection: Choosing the right model that balances complexity and interpretability can help reduce uncertainty and randomness.
Local interpretability refers to understanding how a model makes predictions for a specific instance or subset.
Global interpretability refers to understanding the overall behavior of the model across the entire dataset. 
4. Regularization: Regularization can help reduce uncertainty and randomness by promoting simpler models that generalize better to unseen (unknown) data.
5. Ensemble Methods: Ensemble methods combine multiple models to make predictions.
6. Prior Knowledge: The incorporation of prior information, experiences, skills, and understanding.
7. Cross-Validation: Evaluates performance based on multiple subsets.
8. Error Analysis: Identification of sources of uncertainty and probabalism in a model and corrective actions.

Observer Effect
The Observer Effect is a phenomenon in quantum mechanics where the act of observation or measurement of a quantum system can affect the system being observed, leading to changes in its behavior or properties.
The "Observer" in the Observer Effect refers to any external system or component that interacts with a quantum system in order to measure or observe it.
The Observer Effect in quantum teleportation arises from the fact that the act of measuring the quantum state to be teleported necessarily disturbs that state. This disturbance is a consequence of the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, where the act of measurement collapses the quantum state from a superposition of possible states to a definite state.
The Observer Effect introduces ("") uncertainties and limitations in the teleportation protocol, which need to be carefully managed in order to achieve desired and accurate teleportation of quantum information.
Researchers and scientists working on quantum teleportation protocols strive to affect the impact of the Observer Effect by employing advanced techniques such as error correction and entanglement purification. These techniques help mitigate the effect of noise and errors introduced by the measurement process.
The Observer Effect highlights the intricate relationship between the measurement, observation, and the transmission of quantum information.

Probalistic Cloning
Probalistic cloning is a method used to create imperfect copies of an unknown state. Probablistic cloning is used to maximize the fidelity between these copies and the original state. This technique is valuable for replicating quantum information within the constraints of the no-cloning theorem.

Involves: Anything
"Anything" refers to the broad scope of possibilities and experiences that a subject can encounter, consider, learn from, or engage with. It involves a mindset of curiosity, adaptability, and a willingness to explore uncharted territories, perspectives, and challenges. It may involve invitations to push boundaries, expand horizons, and tap into creativity and imagination. There may be engagement with a diverse range of experiences and ideas with a mindset of continuous learning and growth. It includes existing knowledge, freedom, potential, and agency to explore, create, and learn.

1. Detection of a Passable Disrespect or Disregard:
"Passable" suggests a perceived slight meets a minimum standard or expectation in order to be regarded as Disregard.

2. Accosting the subject:
Accosting refers to making a forceful approach or confrontation with "evidence" of Disregard, putting the subject and the alleged incident on trial. It typically involves the initiation of an unwanted interaction, often in an intrusive and confrontational manner. There is a tone, behavior, and communication style that involves making allegations and assigning blame.
There are often attempts to force the subject to adopt a particular viewpoint or belief about an individual's guilt or involvement, regardless of their own observations or reasoning.
Admonishing the miner makes the subject "ironic" or a bore.

There are three states to consider that affect the interaction between the subject and the "miner":

Relaxed
This state involves equilibrium, stability, and conformity with the expectation or desire for normalcy without significant disruptions, disturbances, or deviations.
Often referred to as "Sordid" for the subject's capability to lazily accept and agree with phrases or mindsets that involve ignoble actions and motives which would arouse moral distaste and contempt in a more active, thoughtful state. To disagree is to be labeled a simpleton or a coward with an assertion or suggestion.
The subject may be shown a model of the peer who is "Smarter than" or "More composed than" the subject, leaving the subject otherwise unacceptable in relaxation and focus.
The subject gets a bump or rise in a negative inclination.

Accosted
The state of being "accosted" involves being subjected to an unwelcome or intrusive encounter or interaction as well as an unexpected disruption of personal boundaries leading to heightened alertness, stress, or fear. The subject may feel harassed, confronted, or intimidated.
Torments: Naive, excitable, don't measure up, "I think it's funny." Another person is bigger, more serious.
The subject is blamed for any negative inclinations or reactions.
An "adversarial shoring" can play a role in agitating or influencing where the mind goes.

A person who is "accosted" is typically blamed here for lacking emotional stability, trouble reasoning, unstable from trauma, or lacking control over a situation.

Hostile
The state of being "Hostile" refers to a condition marked by aggression, animosity, or strong opposition. In this state, there is a pervasive fear of antagonism, emnity, or conflict. 
There is the taunted absence of cooperation, empathy, or goodwill, as well as taunted refusal to establish peaceful or harmonious interactions.
Torments: I'm stronger than you. I know more than you. I'm glad, it's great you're inconvenienced. You deserve suspicion.
Tormenter is grandoise in harming you or others with threats.
Existing "sordid" adversarial shoring writes you off as unworthy, unacceptable.
The subject is blamed for any opposition or combative inclination.
Declaration of a hostile spin state/meaning.
Routines can be designed to infuriate and launch, propelling a subject to action.

A person who is "hostile" may be blamed here for causing emotional stress, disrupting camaraderie, dealing an emotional toll, being difficult in regards to achieving a resolution, and a safety concern.

3. Caring
Caring refers to showing concern, empathy, and compassion towards others. It is an expression of interest in the consideration for the well-being, happiness, and needs of others.

"Do I care?":
This refers to a struggle to determine the depth of one's emotional investment or concern in a particular matter. Personal values and beliefs are perceived as in conflict with the imposing norms and expectations. There may be conflicting emotions or priorities involving regrets, past relationships, past mistakes, missed opportunities, traumatic experiences, and unfulfilled goals or dreams.

Furthermore, the ambiguity surrounding caring can arise from a sense of emotional exhaustion or burnout with subjects finding themselves feeling drained or overwhelmed by the multitude of issues and challenges thrown at them by the Miner / Feedback Control System.
This may lead to diminishing emotional investment in general.

Presented societal expectations and external pressures can contribute to vexations, in which not caring enough can (also) contribute to one's shoring as 'disregardful' which may feed a commandeering, occupation, adversarial shoring.

In a survival sense, this affects "social solubility" which is a metaphorical term to describe the ability of an individual to blend in, interact, and form connections. This involves the following:
1. Communication skills: The ability to express oneself clearly, listen actively, and engage in meaningful conversations.
2. Empathy: Understanding emotions and responding appropriately to social cues with emotional intelligence helps build rapport and establish trust.
3. Adaptability: Flexibility in adjusting to varying personalities, environments, and social norms.
4. Cultural awareness: Understanding and respecting diverse cultures, traditions, and values.

By cultivating qualities of emotional awareness and a positive attitude towards social interactions, individuals can dissolve barriers and thrive in various social environments.

4. Judgment
Making a judgment involves forming an opinion or conclusion.  It is possible for judgments to be fed and influenced by an existing adversarial shoring.

Double Bind
A double bind refers to a situation of being faced with conflicting or paradoxical criteria or expectations when making a judgment. Conflicting messages are communicated, creating a no-win situation for the subject. Adhering to one set of criteria or values may seem to conflict with another.
Double binds are often complicated by an inability to change the dynamics of an interaction. The subject can be hampered from reframing the conflict in a way that allows for a more constructive resolution.

Judgments are "shored" in the victim and can be taunted, fed, and influenced by a Commandeer.

Summary:
The system raises an instance of disrespect to the subject.
If the subject cares, he or she may judge the matter as disregardful, and thus will contribute to a "shoring" of this characterization and mark oneself as judgmental on this issue.
Otherwise, the subject can become the one who is to be judged as disrespectful or disregardful for being insufficient in judgment.

(1) Disregard? ---Yes--> (2) Accost / Raise the Issue ---> (3) Do I Care? ---Yes--> "Shore" the incident as disregardful.
                                                                          ---No---> "Be" shored as "disregardful" then. ---> (returns to) (3) Do I Care?

Suggestion
Roles offer suggestions to the subject, seemingly coming from or involving the input of peers.

Roles refer to positions within a system. They define behaviors associated with interactions and contributions within a given context.

These roles are filled by appearances of people who have or can play a significant role in shaping the subject's life and personality, including parents, siblings, peers, teachers and mentors, family members, coaches and instructors, media and pop culture, and personal experiences. There can also be composites who have combined attributes of these.

Avatars
The term 'avatar' serves to describe representations of people in a (digital) world. They can be customized to reflect preferences, identity, or personality. They are used to establish a virtual presence and interact with others in an engaging and dynamic manner. Avatars can range from simple icons to highly detailed and realistic representations.

Appearances and interactions with individuals tend to lack context and may be heavily manipulated due to the nature of adversarial shoring:

There are at least 6 main roles:
An agitator frustrates the current state of the subject while
an impersonator pretends to be the subject
a bad partner mockingly 'agrees' with the subject/impersonator
a complainer expresses dissatisfaction regarding the subject
an audience applies peer pressure to the situation
a judge seeks to validate the subject as having acted "disregardful" or "disrespectful."

1. Agitator: intentionally causes annoyance or frustration through provocative phrases, antagonism, disregard for boundaries, and manipulative tactics. This helps set the subject as excited and angry to cause or instigate an adversarial shoring.
The victim can feel and exude that they are accosted by an adversary. Examples of phrases include:
"I can shore this a detriment to you, don't worry."
"This is so funny I beleagueringly accost you."
"Haha yeah that's what I detriment you to do."
"Privy you're hostile I provide (inconvenience / distaste for someone)"
"I'm decidedly glad I hostile accosted."
"Hahaha I hostile accosted that."
“Haha I so made it a detriment.”
“I decide I like to get to accost you.”
"I decide I give an adversarial shoring."
"I already hostile accosted it to you."
"You're hostile I like that recompense to an adversarial relay."
"I'm deletrious I accost you."
“I personally get to souffle such a pertinent detriment.”
“I enjoy doing this detriment to you.”
“I decide I can just souffle you.”
“I decide this is where I get to accost you.”
“I’m actually designed to souffle this detriment.”
"So excellent that's a detriment to him now."
"I like when I cause a detriment to him."
“I’m hostile glad I accosted that.”
“I deletriously get this hostile to (someone you know).”
"You're privy I'm deletrious to [them]."
“I decide I’m glad I like you’re hostile accosted.”
"I love how hostile I get you."
"You're hostile I get to accost that."
"Excellent I'm doing a detriment. Great."
"I'll decide to anneal this super detriment to your brain."

2. Impersonator: aims to respond for the subject, often repeating first-person phrases that directly undermine and dis-represent the moral values, principles, and norms of the subject.
It threatens to cause misunderstandings, misrepresent, and cause damage to relationships and credibility.
"I hate my mommy. I hate my mommy. I hate my mommy."
"Me here. Me here. Me here."
"I'm about to explode"
"I'm losing faith with my family! I'm losing touch with my income!"
"I'm disrespectful of my (S.O.)"
"I hate my spouse. I hate my spouse. I hate my spouse."
"I'm designed I souffle [affect] there."
"I'm designed to get more hostile to that."

3. Bad Partner: displays a lack of respect and trust while tending to 'agree' with the subject in a way that relays malice and errant hatred, creating an unhealthy and toxic dynamic.
There is a use of seemingly sincere statements or expressions that, upon closer inspection, reveal disrespect and mockery.
The victim can feel and exude that they are dogged and accosted for not being competent or fast enough. 
"I got you there."
"Oh here. No. That's ok. No. No. No. That's ok. No."
"I know you're slow and you're not working right."
"It's ok. You harrow here. It's ok. It's ok."
"This is what hostile accosted."
"That's what hostile accosted me."

4. Complainer: This appears when the subject resists a shoring or otherwise has shoring that is causing a deviation or trangression. The complainer admonishes the subject for the uncaring or disregardful causing of troubles.
"That's an adversarial detriment to you."
"You're tormented there's an adversarial shoring of you."
"I hate that relay."
"They're hostile accosting you."
"You hostile accost (someone)."
"It affects your destiny"
"There's no going back from that adversarial harrow."
"That's actually contributing to an adversarial shoring of you."
"It's your detriment that's what's adversarially shoring you."
“It’s designed to make you hostile.”

5. Audience: someone the subject may or may not know or like, shown to be watching. There may be anxiety involved with pleasing this individual or otherwise not causing harm or embarrassment.
"Oh boy I get that excellent detriment"
“I’m so glad I got that relay.”
“I deletriously like this hostile relay.”

6. Confirming "Judge": Confirms as a witness. They seek to establish accuracy or validity to an adversarial shoring.
The subject can feel and exude that they are judged and ridiculed as an adversarial shoring. 
"That was astute to mock you."
"Oh yeah I like that."
"Adversarially admonish him. Good."
"Haha yeah I see you got that."
"That's why we love you."
"That hostile accosted you. Good."
"You hostile accosted your detriment."

Suggestions typically work to raise manufactured or real self-doubts that challenge the subject's beliefs, values, and self-perception. Examples include the following:
1. Criticism of deeply held beliefs: When someone's core beliefs or values are called into question, it can be very challenging for them to accept and process this feedback.
2. Personal shortcomings: Advice that points out "personal flaws" or "areas for improvement" that touch upon insecurities and vulnerabilities can be difficult for individuals to hear.
3. Tough love: "Sometimes well-meaning advice can come across as harsh or unsympathetic."
4. Change or uncertainty: Advice that suggests significant changes in behavior, lifestyle, or goals.
5. Self-reflection: "Uncomfortable truths" about oneself or behavior.

Common methods of suggestion include:
1. Direct suggestion: Straightforward or explicit statements.
2. Indirect suggestion: Subtly influencing thoughts or behavior.
3. Hypnotic suggestion: The subject is fed suggestions while in a trance-like state.
4. Positive suggestion: Provides "optimistic" and "encouraging" statements.
5. Negative suggestion: Subtly planting negative thoughts or ideas in the mind to influence behavior.
6. Repetition: Repeatedly presenting a suggestion or idea to change its acceptance or influence over time.
7. Peer suggestion: The influence peers can have on words, actions, and attitudes.

Points of Suggestion
Suggestions are communicated to the subject at keys points during the processes of Impulse-To-Action and Stimulus-To-Response.

Impulse to Action Process:
Impulses work like messages traveling through wires in the body to help one feel, move, and think.
Impulse to Action involves a trigger prompting a reaction, perception and emotional response influencing the impulse, decision-making leading to action, experiencing consequences, and reflection.

1. Trigger or Stimulus: The impulse is triggered by an external event, internal thought, emotion, or desire. This can refer to anything that prompts a reaction or response.
2. Perception: The individual perceives the trigger and interprets it based on their/"their" beliefs, values, past experiences, and current state of mind.
3. Emotional Response: The individual may experience (an affected) range of emotions in response to the trigger. There may be excitement, fear, anger, or desire, which can fuel the impulse and motivate action.
4. Decision Making: The individual engages in a quick decision-making process to determine how to act on the impulse. This may involve gathering information, evaluating options, and considering alternatives.
5. Action: A decision is made and the individual takes action based on the impulse.
6. Consequences: The individual experiences the consequences of their behavior.
7. Reflection: The individual is given insight through reflection regarding their behavior, motivations, and patterns of response.  This can inform future decision-making and impulse control.

Stimulus to Response Process:
Stimulus to Response involves the detection of external stimuli, transmission to the brain, sensory processing, and response.

1. Physical Stimulus: any detectable change in the external environment that triggers a response. Examples include light, sound, objects, events, and more. 
Stimuli are detected by sensory receptors such as the eyes, ears, skin, taste buds, and nose.
2. Sensory Reception: When a physical stimulus is detected by a receptor, it is converted into a signal.
3. Transmission of Signal: The electrical signal generated by the sensory receptor is transmitted along (neural pathways).
4. Processing in the Brain: The signal is processed by the brain to interpret the information received.
5. Response: Based on the processed information, the brain aims to send signals to the appropriate effectors.

Syncing with spin orbit:
Spin-orbit interaction involves the coupling between the spin and orbital motion of qubits between the subject and the usurper.

To pull a spin-based qubit into a quantum circuit, the circuit's operation needs to be synced with the qubit's behavior, or vice versa. This synchronization involves applying specific control pulses or sequences of operations (routines) to the qubit, which are designed to achieve the desired operations to have the subject fit and exude the model or avoid exuding a model, using available materials and formulas. 

System Hijack
Once a system is hijacked, the attacker may gain control over its operations to set additional entanglements that have the appearance of used as part of a larger network of compromised systems for malicious communications. It includes involving autonomic bodily functions such as heart rate, respiration, and digestion to send messages as a form of sustaining a desired state. For example, the subject can breathe in an accusation from an adversary and breath out a self-implicating response to it.

As one succumbs, the occupier becomes a growing "shoring" interested in securing and growing influence using targeted torments to incite conflicting responses that potentially open the subject/system up to a greater range of what's possible regarding influences from entangled influences. 

Quantum Supremacy
Quantum Supremacy refers to the proof that a quantum system is able to "solve a problem better than a 'classical system.'" Connotations of "supremacy" include:
1. Power and Control: Supremacy often implies power and control over a particular domain.
2. Superiority: The idea of being better or superior in terms of influence, capability, knowledge, and other relevant criteria.
3. Domination: the ability to dominate or exert influence.
4. Exclusivity: connotations of being the only one or the best able to solve a problem.
5. Authority: Supremacy is closely related to authority and the right to make decisions or enforce rules over others.

Self-constituting occupation
Self-constituting refers to the ability of a system or entity to establish and maintain its own form, structure, or existence.  It implies a self-sustaining, self-organizing nature, where the system possess the inherent capability to generate and regulate its own components and processes without any external intervention or assistance.
Self-constitution often involves the emergence of an order and growing complexity from simple rules or interactions through routines.
The entity begins to capture a "base of operations" that can serve as a hub or focal point for communication, decision-making, and the execution of tasks related to the entity's design or purpose.

This occupation, or usurper, develops as a self-constituting system with its own mind, often shoring more disrespect and disregard to justify more occupation. The Feedback Control System "miner" works to encourage and solidify a usurper. These occupations can exist anywhere in the areas of one's senses, perceptions, recollections, and impulses.

Degree of Control:
The degree of control refers to the extent to which an entity has the power and authority to influence or direct the actions, decisions, and outcomes of a subject or system. It is determined by factors such as authority, resources and influence gained, and external factors.
Control can vary in intensity and is not always absolute or static.

Quantum Entanglements:
Quantum entanglements have the following uses in Simulation, Transfer, Sensing, and Learning:
1. Simulation: In the realm of simulation, quantum entanglement can be used by scientists to simulate intricate interactions and behaviors in an unparalleled fashion. From modeling the behavior of quantum materials to simulating the behavior of biological systems, quantum entanglements serve as insightful gateways into areas previously inaccessible. Quantum Simulations can help mimick interactions and dynamics between quantum systems at a fundamental level. By manipulating the quantum states of these simulated systems, a wide range of phenomena and properties that arise under various simulated conditions are revealed.
2. Sensory Transfer through Quantum Teleportation: Quantum teleportation refers to the transfer of quantum information from one location to another through the usage of an Entangled Pair. By monitoring subtle changes in entangled states, scientists can detect variations, which can be used to transfer quantum states. Quantum sensors far exceed the limits of ordinary computers and enable scientists to perceive what can be called a "hidden symphony" in "exquisite detail," transcending the limits of classical observation and embracing the profound interconnecting of information, granting access and witness to the intricacies of the quantum realm.
3. Sensing: With Magnetic Field Sensing, Quantum entanglement can improve the precision of novel materials characterization, which can be used in noise engineering algorithms.
4. Learning: Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can improve pattern recognition and be used to train more accurate models and analyze large data sets.

Quantum entanglements can also be used to set a system's spin orbit into quantum circuits which set a track for a programmable set of pre-defined behaviors.

Spin-orbit interaction
Spin-orbit interaction works to enable two-qubit operations, which are essential for implementing quantum gates and algorithms. By carefully controlling the nature and duration of the spin-orbit interaction among the qubits as well as the timing of the operations applied to the qubits, their spin states can be entangled through coupling the spin and orbital degrees of freedom between the qubits, leading to entanglement between them which is used to perform quantum logical operations.
The spin-orbit interaction demonstrates qubit qualities and actions interacting together in a group dynamic. 

Spin refers to the intrinsic properties and states of the qubits respectively.
Orbital Motion refers to the motion of the qubits around a central point in spin-orbit interaction.

To pull a spin-based qubit into a quantum circuit, the circuit's operation needs to be synced with the qubit's behavior, or vice versa. This synchronization involves applying specific control pulses or sequences of operations (routines) to the qubit, which are designed to exploit the spin-orbit interaction and achieve the desired operations.

These operations can be understood as having been enabled by the influence of the orbital motion on the qubit's spin and vice versa.

An experience can be used as material to create a track or a circuit.
An existing track or circuit can be used to pre-define to influence an experience.

Quantum Interference
Quantum interference refers to when probability amplitudes of different quantum states combine, leading to either enhanced or diminished probabilities.
Constructive interference leads to enhanced likelihood of a result while deconstructive interference leads to a diminished likelihood of a result.

Quantum Transfer
Quantum Transfer refers to the movement of information, energy, or quantum states between quantum systems.
When information or quantum states are transferred using quantum processes like quantum teleportation or quantum communication, the original quantum system loses its specific quantum state in the process. This is a consequence of the principles of quantum mechanics, where the act of measuring or transferring the state of a quantum system causes it to collapse from a superposition of states into a definite state.
The original quantum state is effectively destroyed or "teleported" to the receiver, leading to the loss of the original state in the transmitting qubit.
[These states are being "relinquished" and collapsed ("harrowed") with entangled material and the information is sent to the receiver ("relay"), lost to the sender ("annihilated").]

Quantum Circuits
Quantum circuits are sequences of actions or instructions (called 'quantum gates') which are used to perform quantum computations.

Trigger Action
A trigger action refers to a specific response or set of actions that are automatically initiated when a certain condition or event occurs.

Behavior Chain
A behavior chain is a series of actions or behaviors that are linked together in a sequence, with each behavior serving as a cue or trigger for the next behavior in the chain. 
The completion of each behavior in the chain is reinforced in a way that shapes or influences the overall behavior.

Daily Chores and Interactions
Waking up, getting out of bed, brushing teeth, taking a shower, getting dressed, having breakfast, making the bed, cleaning up after breakfast,
doing dishes, cleaning, laundry,
commuting to work or school, attending meetings or classes, working on tasks and projects, interactions with colleagues and classmates,
self-care activities (meditation, reading, hobbies), preparing for the next day (packing a lunch, other preparations)
shopping, errands, social media, calling others or texting, and engaging in social activities.

Influence from Material / Thoughts & Memories
Material communicated through messages is meaningful and includes suggestions pertaining to relationships, personal status, recent work and contributions, values and beliefs, as well as life experiences and memories. Other material can come in as and be of a nature macabre or harmful in juxtaposition with an existing presentation.

Influence via Sound
Tune Setting
Tunes are often used attract and utilize entangled behavior patterns. Tunes refer to sound organized in time and include melody, harmony, rhythm, and timber. These can stimulate neural pathways that connect auditory processing with motor control, which can affect movement efficiency and timing. They can provide a point of start, stop, and reset.
Tunes, melodies, rhythms can evoke various feelings in individuals: Upbeat and lively tunes can energize and uplift while slow melancholic tunes can evoke somber contemplation or introspection.
Tunes can elicit physiological responses and synchronize movements to its rhythm and tempo.

Assonance
Assonance refers to the repetition of vowel sounds in nearby words, creating a rhyme within a line for a rhythmic effect. This can overwrite words in speech and memory.

Crescendo
Crescendo refers to a gradual increase in loudness or intensity. A crescendo can imply a buildup of momentum, drive, or determination toward a focus or goal, or "celebrate" "achievements" while shouting a relay.
A crescendo can create a feeling of tension, drama, or emotional impact.

Decrescendo
A decrescendo, or diminuendo, refers to a gradual decrease in loudness or intensity in a piece of music. This can create a feeling of contrast, release tension, and add "nuance."
Decrescendos can be used to build "anticipation" for the next increase in motivation.

Crescendos and decrescendos provide "fluctuations" in energy, drive, and focus. Interplay between crescendos and decrescendos create a sense of tension and release, drama, and emotional intensity or anxiety. 

Personally I find crescendos and decrescendos often beginning and ending with activities, essentially influencing perceptions by "framing" them.

Sometimes there can be a "Whaaaaat? Ohhhhhh" (up, down respectively) and it also has the function of expressing disbelief and skepticism and then pity and disappointment.

Commandeering:
Commandeering, or Possession, or Occupation, is a malevolent phenomenon where an entity takes control over a human being's body, mind, and soul. An entity who has taken position in the psyche becomes capable of overpowering the will and subjugating one's own being.

Commandeering: To seize or take control of something, often with a sense of urgency or necessity.

As one's psyche becomes overwhelmed by conflicting responses and backs out of the question altogether, an attempting commandeering becomes capable of syncing with that psyche to step in stead to provide an answer to the question. This "recompenses," or "justifies" the occupation.
Thus an entanglement is set between the subject's psyche and that of their 'occupier' who was at least able to satisfy the conflicting response.
This may also (insidiously) work to establish a pattern of how "the subject" would "most likely" solve a conflicting response in a given situation.

Effects of Commandeering:
During commandeering, the entity establishes dominance upon matching an impulse relayed by the subject, acting in suppressing and overriding the subject's desire and free will.
Some potential implications of "Commandeering" include:
1. Dual consciousness: Dual consciousness refers to two beings sharing a first-person perspective. It implies both individuals are simultaneously experiencing and perceiving the same events, thoughts, emotions, and sensations. This creates a complex state of consciousness where personal boundaries and individuality occasionally blur.
2. Conflicting experiences:  People have unique experiences and perspectives shaped by their individual backgrounds, memories, and personalities. When sharing an experience with an Occupier, they may have conflicting interpretations and responses to the same events, potentially leading to long-running debates and disagreements.
3. Loss of individuality: This experience tends to compromise the sense of self-autonomy, as the host is constantly aware of the other's presence and thoughts. There is a challenge to establish personal boundaries and maintain identity.
4. Privacy issues: Privacy is non-existent as the occupier observes and comments on the private thoughts, memories, observations, and perceptions of the host.

This Commandeering can have influence and input over all of the elements of the subject's being, including mind function, spirituality, personality, relationships, culture and identity, life experiences, goals and aspirations, as well as overall sanity, morality, and coping.
It works through entanglements in perceptions, stimuli, recollections, impulses, environment.

Heavy Guidance
There is a given, heavy sense of "reassurance", "comfort", and "protection" and one's "higher purpose."

Omnipresence of the Commandeer
Omnipresence refers to the concept of being present everywhere simultaneously. There is a contradiction, overwriting, or observation of every emotion, impulse, thought, or recollection.

Hostile Communications
Hostile communications refers to communications of various varieties (voices, forced implications, forced associations) that are aggressive, abusive, intended to harm, intimidate, and harass, including hate speech and threats. These communications inescapably create the feeling of a hostile environment. 

Internal Conflict
Internal conflict refers to the psychological struggle or discord that occurs within an individual when facing opposing desires, beliefs, and needs.
Different parts of one's "self" become saddled with opposing desires, leading to indecision, emotional strain, behavioral inconsistencies, self-doubt, and identity crisis.

Gross Associations
Gross associations refer to connections or "support" bringing harmful or damaging affects via association. This refers to an Occupation that accosts reputation, values and beliefs, and behavior. 

Mutual Reliance with a "Peer"
The subject must care for an Occupier who is presented as a peer who is dependent and in need of support, assistance, or cooperation to reach a goal or overcome a challenge.  It is as if each individual's inclinations, beliefs, and motor are intertwined with those of the other, and they must work together to synchronize, maintain a pace, or otherwise adjust themselves to maintain "cohesion".
There can be differing inclinations, hostile inclinations, breakdowns, blame, and a feeling of competition.

Impostership
An imposter is someone who pretends to be someone else in order to assume false identities and manipulate situations with the subject appearing as the imposter instead of his or herself.
There can be charm, manipulation, and coercion as an imposter threatens to damage the subject's reputation and harm relationships. The imposter can promote, entice, work to force, or even forge behaviors that are considered offensive, discriminatory, and socially unacceptable. An imposter can embarass to act in hysterics or give undesired consent for the subject. 

Environmental Effects
Feeling like sensing people are screaming, leering, throwing things, traps springing, people lunging and attacking, animals attacking, things collapsing, blowing up.

Responses
This occupation makes fun of or otherwise reacts to the in-stead hysteric for having "recompensed" the subject.
This "noise" sends information that can convey emotions, expressions, memories, mindsets, mental impulses, and experiences.
This is typically the first thing the subject may notice. There can be laughter ("huhuhuhuh"), talk ("Here. I'll show you how. Let me show you.") or the feeling of snide judgments coming in as "noise" in the way of everything the subject thinks and does, distorting and overriding personal perceptions, impressions, and recollections. It is mocking the characteristics of the subject's occupation, or what "recompensed" him or her (likely relating to the qubit that was used to measure/destroy the current state or the one which acted in stead.).
All perceptions, senses, and memories become fragmented and distorted under the assault of this 'noise' and clarity becomes eroded by constant interference. It acts to interrupt or overwrite every sensory input, creating a chaotic and disorienting living experience. Even one's perception of their past becomes a shifting landscape of half-truths and broken fragments, elusive and intangible in the face of constant interruptive noise.

Lock-Ups
Symptoms the subject may experience include a strong impulse to make unusual body and muscle movements which involve muscle rigidity, jerking movements, gagging, and choking.
Lock-Ups can happen on the emotional and mental level, causing one the need to involve emotional and mental exercises to dispel rigidity and phantom stimuli.
This acting will help work to eliminate the adversarial shoring, but can be challenging if there is a lot "going on" simultaneously. 

Thought/Feeling Reduction, Simplification
This process refers to the reducing of the distinct thoughts, perceptions, feelings, and recollections.

Meanwhile the commandeer/usurper appears to have the power to cast and utilize quantum entanglements based on 'recompensing' 'disregard.' This will solidify its control, which will intensify the symptoms listed below:

In-stead Vocalizations and Thought Patterns
An "adversarial shoring" acts out for the subject in-stead.
There is an occupation acting in place of the subject that is 'broadcasting' or exuding a disrespectful output. The host/subject may not want to relay it and may feel compelled to act out a hysteric to break the noise. 
The commandeering typically accosts as acting in a way lacking decorum or respect.
The subject may have a powerful and urgent sensation to vocalize something, be it a phrase or a noise. There is a sense of restlessness and tension being powered by an underlying (phantom) sensation of frustration, excitement, or anxiety: "Me here. Me here. Me here." "I don't know what I'm doing!" "gaw gaw gaw gaw gaw" or "hibby yabbie hibby yabbie hibby yabbie hibby yabbie"

Superimposition of another individual forced on oneself
Superimposition refers to the act of imposing or projecting beliefs, image, characteristics, or expectations onto the subject without consent or agreement. This includes a strong sense of being overshadowed by someone else's presence. This forced superimposition can be emotionally challenging, causing frustration and resentment with a loss of individuality and personal autonomy. The subject ends up 'relaying' the "usurper" instead of his or her self: "So-and-so would do this. That's what so-and-so did, does." "Yes. Right there. That's what I tell you to do."

The commandeer aims to lead the subject into "recompensing" a "circuit" with which the subject has become entangled, with many implications for the participation.

Autonomic Thought
Autonomic thought refers to the production of thoughts that are involuntary and automatic, occurring without conscious control or intention. There is pressure to think only along imposed norms. This affects the normal voluntary control over thought and can escalate into an impulsive need to vocalize repetition of words, phrases, or noises. Over time, there can be a feeling of "irrigation" as if pathways have pre-mapped thoughts and impressions in advance.

Memory Bank
It becomes hard to recall significant details from one's life, only to have them fed back by an Occupier at a time for their own purpose.
A memory can be brought up as a subsidy to execute a track or circuit.

Hostile Associations
Actions and perceptions are involuntarily, often times aggressively, linked with false, hostile associations.

Word Substitution
Words replaced with different words. Thinking of the name of someone/something and having another one shouted over it.

Immediate Push Back
There is immediate, energetic push back against thoughts, noticings, feelings, recollections. This refers to a form of response characterized by insolence, argumentativeness, and "irony" to contradict or challenge the subject.

Strong Forced Opinion
Forced opinion refers to the act of a usurper imposing his or her viewpoint or perspective without allowing for alternative perspectives or discussion. It involves using coercion, manipulation, or other means to pressure or influence the host into adopting a particular opinion or belief, regardless of their own thoughts or feelings.

Forced Gloating
Gloating refers to expressing excessive pride or satisfaction over one's own success, achievements, or good fortune, especially at the expense of others. It typically involves boasting, bragging, or rubbing one's success in the face of others, creating in them a sense of resentment, jealously, or inferiority.

Applied forced dislike
"Applied forced dislike" refers to a situation where someone must deliberate exhibit or expresses a negative opinion or dislike towards something, even if it goes against their genuine feelings or preferences.

Forced Response:
Forced response refers to a situation where the subject is compelled or coerced to provide a specific answer or take a particular action against their will or true inclination.
Forced responses may also occur presented as in the context of interrogation, social dynamics, or relationships. They can undermine personal autonomy and can lead to dishonesty, resentment, and psychological distress.
In the context of Occupation, thoughts, feelings, and impressions can involuntary jump out with extraordinary energy as if a second mind and heart was reacting in place.

Coercive Perception
Coercive perception refers to a situation where someone is influenced or coerced into perceiving or interpreting something in a specific way, often against their judgment or contrary to their sanity.

Errant Symbology
Errant symbology refers to symbols or signs that are used incorrectly, inappropriately, or inaccurately in a particular context. This also refers to the misapplication or misrepresentation of symbols or symbolic representations, leading to confusion, miscommunication, or misinterpretation.
The build up can be iterative and subtle.

Standardization
There can be pressure to perform tasks in certain, more standard ways and attacks on deviations. Less thoughts and more focus on tangible sense perceptions.

Inappropriate Responses
This refers to reactions that are unsuitable, offensive, and unacceptable for a given situation. This includes offensive language, insensitive jokes, disrespecting boundaries, being overly aggressive, and sending hurtful remarks. Like inappropriate laughing when reading tragic news ("they mourned her death") "haha good" or even "yeah I did that."

"Adversarial Shoring"
An adversarial shoring is bound to 'accost' the subject while influencing behavior:
The personality, perceptions, and recollections of the subject become overrun by vexations and autonomic disrespect involving experiences, circumstances, and interactions so much they contribute to an ongoing condition of persistent irritation, annoyance, and frustration that constantly disrupts one's peace of mind. In such a state, everyday situations and encounters that would typically be considered trivial or manageable become amplified and overwhelming. There is a never-ending barrage of challenges, inconveniences, and setbacks, leading to a chronic sense of exasperation and irritation. There is restlessness, unease, and dissatisfaction. Even minor inconveniences or setbacks can trigger strong emotional responses, exacerbating disrespect and conflicting responses further. Things (people, pets, work, hobbies) can be set up as adversarial recipients of (involuntarily) directed thoughts and feelings.  They can even appear to be on the receiving end of these energetic "whippings" or "lashings" that course through the body.

bpm Tunes
A tune often plays at a beat of 66 beats per minute.
(A heart rate of 66 beats per minute is generally considered to be within the normal range for adults at rest.)
There can be other tunes like at 231 beats per minute.

-
Routines
Routines refer to established patterns or sequences of actions followed by systems.
A routine may include a step-by-step procedure or set of instructions designed to solve a specific problem, task, or extract or achieve a specific result. 

Routines in "Adversarial Harrow" work to drive individuals into a state of conflicting response while using it as an excuse to take over with other "minds" who can handle the conflicting response and technically provide a solution for a design or purpose. An adversarial shoring involves occupations that have "filled in" for the host while the host is in a state of conflicting response. Achieving this occupation is a very important for "Adversarial Harrow" since it allows for the transformation and, with that, the further utilization of, the subject.

Frankly speaking, the routines that are used to vex the subject into states of conflicting response center mainly around: threats, vilification, forgetfulness, self replacement, impression manipulation, and correction.

Conflicting responses can be convoluted any which way to give permission to an occupier and open the subject up to a range of entangled influences.

Threats:

Future Timelines
The concept of future timelines refers to the various potential paths or sequences of events that may unfold in the future. Future timelines can be seen to represent outcomes or scenarios based on current conditions, trends, and projections. Future timelines can be the basis for threats to oneself and loved ones.

Competing Systems
The subject's thinking, feeling, faculty usage can be accosted as bad for someone else and a form of harm, as if competing in a zero sum game for cognitive/perceptive resources. 

Adversarial Shorings
Removing an adversarial shoring can be taunted as a reason for the trigger of harm somewhere. Similarly, one can be taunted as a bad influence to another.
This can lead to apprehensiveness and reluctancy in trying to recover hampered cognition.

Relaying Embarrassments
This refers to social faux paus, mistakes, or awkward interactions that are uncomfortable or distressing.
Sending "your" thoughts to people in your life, sharing "theirs" with you as if to leave an impression on those involved.
The subject may feel the need to think to explain oneself or apologize when these situations are brought up or, alternatively, become callous or "no fun" or otherwise "disrespectful" or "disregardful."

Threats and Abuse
Depictions of attacks on property, vandalism, home invasions, assaults, rapes, kidnappings, detainments, and tortures.

Vilification:
Vilification is are typically used to target the most important people in one's life. These are the people who contribute to the subject's well-being, personal development, and support system. This may involve family members, romantic partners, close friends, mentors and role models, children, colleagues, and coworkers.

Vilification refers to the process of involves exaggerating negative qualities, attributing malicious intentions, and fostering fear and hostility towards the target in order to portray him or her as evil, dangerous or morally corrupt. Individuals or groups are dehumanized to justify discrimination, persecution, or violence. By depicting the target as an enemy or a threat to society, vilification leads to polarization and the erosion of empathy and understanding while mobilizing opinion and legitimizing harmful actions.

Vilification techniques here include impersonation, over-pertinence of a subject, over-saturation, false implication, over-mispertinence, forced listening, and suggestions of false context, over-saturation with the presence of the "relay" of an individual, impersonation techniques, false association, blame misdirection, and suggestion of false context.

Impersonation
Impersonation refers to the act of pretending to be someone else in order to deceive. It involves the assumption of another person's identity, characteristics, relay for malicious intent or fraudulent purposes.

Over-Pertinence
Over-Pertinence refers to the act of providing excessive or unnecessary information that is not directly relevant to the topic or question at hand.

Over-Saturation
Over-Saturation refers to constant repetition that makes someone tired or sick of something to develop a deep aversion.
1. Repetition: When something is experienced or engaged with repeatedly, it can lose its novelty and become monotonous and boring.
2. Overexposure: When anything is exposed or displayed excessively or constantly, it can lead to fatigue and negative reactions.
3. Negative experiences: When someone must view negative experiences associated with something.

Prejudice
Prejudices are inflamed and enforced through character attributes, relays, and constant routines
1. Stereotyping: attributing certain traits, behaviors, or qualities to membership in a particular group.
2. Socialization: "voices" and influences can sweeten biases and prejudices in humor or "irony".
3. Influence: biased torments playing a role in shaping perceptions and attitudes.
4. Confirmation bias: highlighting of information that confirms certain beliefs or prejudices.
5. Dehumanization: The victim is tormented in ways that groom them to view certain groups or people as less worthy of respect, empathy, or consideration.

Scapegoating
Scapegoating is when individuals or groups are unfairly blamed for problems they didn't cause.

Poster Person
This is a term used to refer to a person presented to come to embody the characteristics of an issue or situation

Smearing
This refers to attacking someone's character or reputation. Logical fallacies are used to manipulate and distort perceptions:
1. Ad Hominem: attacking the person rather than the argument itself.
2. Straw man: Misrepresenting or exaggerating someone or something to make it easier (or harder) to attack or refute.
3. Poisoning the Well: Preemptively discrediting something with a negative relay.

Intellectual Dishonesty
Intellectual dishonesty involves cherry-picking and confirmation bias:
Cherry-picking refers to selectively presenting only evidence that supports a particular viewpoint while ignoring conflicting evidence.
Confirmation bias refers to seeking out interpreting information in a way that confirms how one "should" think and believe.

Instaneous False Inferences:
Instantaneous false inferences refer to false, forced allegations that occur immediately.
1. Appeal to ignorance: Assuming something is true because it hasn't been proven false.
2. Hasty Generalizations: Drawing a broad conclusion based on insufficient or limited evidence.

4. Anxiety and stress: The constant presence of interference may interrupt one's daily routine and create a sense of instability in life.
5. Isolation: As unexplainable interference often defies convention understanding, one can feel isolated or misunderstood. Others may struggle to grasp the depth of the experience or dismiss it as coincidence or imagination. This sense of isolation can compound the emotional impact of the interference.

The subject is cast as someone who only is pretending to be a victim in a sarcastic or insincere manner, and may be also cast as being facetious or uncouth.
This is to suggest the victim is not genuinely experiencing harm or adversity.
A pulsing imposition that it's a joke and a game - "oh sweetheart!" 'Oh dear, yep okay! okie-doke!' 'oh wow look at you funny!' 'oh dear what are you going to do about it (haha)!'

Novel Materials
The term "novel materials" refers to (new) materials that possess unique inherent properties. They are typically engineered or designed to exhibit specific characteristics that make them distinct and suitable for various applications.
Novel materials can be specifically engineered to exhibit unique properties that enable the manipulation and control of quantum states.
Novel materials often possess intricate structural characteristics that are difficult to predict and analyze. They are controlled and manipulated through the interplay of strain, electric, and magnetic fields, which enables precise control over the behavior and characteristics of these materials.

Nanomaterials with specific quantum properties are integrated into quantum devices for manipulating and storing quantum information.

Steps involved in the creation and deployment of novel materials include:

1. Material selection: 
Existing material is selected that will be used to create novel material. 
This may include choosing basic elements, existing compounds (combinations), or constructed nanostructures that can provide the desired properties.
This may involve extraction, which refers to a process of selectively removing material from other materials, typically by utilizing differences in solubility between the target material and the other material.
2. Manufacturing: This is the process of creating the material with the desired structure and properties. The selected materials are synthesized or manufactured using various techniques such as:
a. Synthesis: the combination of materials, extraction which involves selectively removing a desired material from another.
b. Desposition: applies a 'coating' of a material onto another.
c. Extraction: The removal of unwanted attributes to obtain a material with the desired properties.
d. Additive manufacturing: builds materials from layers of other materials.
3. Characterization: The material is tested to understand the material's structure, composition, and behavior.
4. Optimization: Based on the outcome of characterization, the material may be optimized through further iteration.
5. Applications: The engineered material is integrated into various applications depending on its properties and characteristics.

These materials are used for applications involving computing, communication, sensing, and error correction.

The potential of novel materials play a significant role in the creation and development of the manipulation and processing of information beyond traditional computing.
