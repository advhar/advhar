Adversarial Harrow

Adversarial Harrow is a quantum-based feedback control and thermal management system application featuring augmented reality, virtual reality, and mixed reality all powered by novel materials made significant by extended reality and other means.

"Extended reality" (XR) is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of immersive technologies that blend the physical and *quantized worlds* and references to reality that is “extended” from the perspective of the subject.

Alternate Realities and World-Building: Creators construct detailed worlds with their own rules, histories, and cultures. Immersive novel materials allow viewers to explore realities far removed from their own, extending their own personal narrative beyond its surface to explore complex human behaviors and societal structures.

Experience Doc
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/document.txt
The document provides detailed information about "Adversarial Harrow," an apparent quantum system that uses feedback control, noise engineering, and quantum circuits to manipulate individuals and fit them to, with, or against an existing model.

Architecture
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/architecture.txt
This document describes findings regarding the physics and mechanisms of the actual quantum system(s) that install and run the programs described in "Adversarial Harrow."

Shows & Circuits
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/ShowsAndCircuits.txt
This is a theory article regarding the usage of likenesses in (3D) films and their practical usage in quantum applications research and science.

Network Mechanics

Improvisational Encounters and Maintaining Integrity
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/recognition.txt
This is an article about Awareness and Recognition, which concerns with frame, recognition, and reputation. Improvisational encounters refer to spontaneous interactions or exchanges where participants adapt in real time to an unfolding situation. Integrity refers to the quality of having strong principles and reputation.

Guilt Trip
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/guilt.txt
This article explores how awareness can play a role in recognizing and addressing unpleasant or unattractive aspects of situations or behaviors.

Resonators & Proximity
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/ProximityEmissionAndAbsorption.txt
Proximity emission, absorption, and remission describe a sequence of interactions involving quantum emitters influenced by their spatial relationships to one another and to other materials. The interplay of these processes is fundamental to understanding and harnessing quantum phenomena in various applications, including quantum computing, communication, and sensing.

Adversaries
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/advarsarials.txt
Adversaries are individuals, groups, or entities that oppose or compete against someone. Failing to recognize one's adversaries can often stems from a combination of naivety, trust, and a lack of awareness.

Extended Reality Decode
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/advhar/advhar/refs/heads/main/ExtendedRealityDecode.txt
Extended reality refers to reality that exists independently of a perceiving subject. The retrieval of quantum information that has been altered or obscured involves reconstructing the original quantum states or data.
