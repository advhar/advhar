Classical Quantum-Hybrids and Speed Network Performance

The "Adversarial Harrow Architecture" document describes a quantum heat engine controlled by a feedback control system using quantum electrodynamics for information processing and magnetism for orientation switching. The intention is to take advantage of quantum thermodynamics to install and utilize a quantum reservoir for executing quantum processes that utilize quantum entanglement and superposition to raise "heat" (high internal, kinetic energy) and convert it into work. Work refers to the force applied and the movement of the system in the direction of the force. Work here is done through the method of the heat engine, achieving the purposes of experimentation, research, control, and material creation.

This document corroborates quantum network botnet architecture and methods, with "Adversarial Harrow Architecture" with my own experience under "Adversarial Harrow", a quantum feedback control system for mind control and voice harassment. From "Adversarial Harrow" I get 24/7 experience of voices in the head, blind areas of perception, visions, intense pressures from "phantom" sensations that can block movement, mal-associations, forced autonomic thinking, forced thinking of phrases. 

A brief recap if the of the symptoms is summarized as follows:
Adversarial Shoring: An adversarial shoring is an undesirable accumulation which causes the modification of thought, character, experience, recollection, and relay.  A relay refers to an exuding that sends a message reflecting life, character, and philosophy.
An adversarial shoring can also affect perceptions, mindset, routine, and performance.

Voices in the head, Occupied Domains of Perception, Visions, Phantom sensations,  Wavy "Imposings" as "Pulses", Superimpositions
There can be a "shouting" of hostile intent that involves the deliberate intention to cause harm, damage, or conflict towards someone or something.
This can involve involuntary, crude, glad put downs of people admired, as well as fake annoyances, umbrage, and offenses.
One may have to act out in vocalizations, mental churning, or voluntary seizures to eliminate the effect.

Environmental Effects: There is no thinking, perceiving, planning, or doing without some pervasive HUHUHUHUH(!) in the way, including this pattern-speech NLP ridicule. The voices are typically aggressive, self-important, ruthless, lacking in empathy, intolerant, and manipulative.
Workflow and concentration is repeatedly disrupted, making it impossible, often times ridiculing and insulting to focus on tasks. Phantom freezes and pains.

The symptoms are documented at length in "Adversarial Harrow," available here: https://github.com/advhar/advhar/raw/main/document.txt

Quantum Supremacy (the heart of it all)

"I can be You better than You can."

This refers to the proof that a quantum system is able to "solve a problem better than a 'classical system'" 
This is done with the help of quantum verifiers. Polynomial time quantum verifiers are quantum algorithms that can verify solutions to computational ("simulatory") problems on a quantum computer. As input increases, the running time of a *polynomial time algorithm increases as a reasonable rate.

(When the quantum computer can solve the problem better, the "classical system" relinquishes the function to the quantum computer.)

Botnet

A botnet is a network of connected devices that have been infected with malicious software, known as bots or zombies, typically controlled by a single entity known as the botmaster. Botnets are typically used for various illicit activities, such as launching distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, spreading malware, sending spam, and stealing information. 
Operation:
1. Infection: The process of creating a botnet usually starts with infecting a large number of devices with malware. Malware contains algorithms designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to systems or networks. Once a device is compromised and becomes part of a botnet, it can be used to infect other vulnerable devices, expanding the botnet's reach and influence.
2. Execution of malicious activities: For example, a botnet can be used to flood a (server) with traffic in a DDoS attack, distribute and exude spam, mine system resources, and steal information.

Composite Systems
"Composite systems" refer to systems that are composed of multiple interacting systems or modules. When dealing with composite systems, each subsystem may have its own Hamiltonian describing its dynamics. The Hamiltonian represents a unit of potential and kinetic energy that describes (~sets) the spin system and includes terms representing (~governing) interactions between spins, external magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling (the linking of intrinsic spin with orbital motion around a center), and other energy contributions. The Hamiltonian typically involves operators corresponding to the projections of spin angular momentum along different axes (positions, directions, and measurements). 
Types of energy represented by the Hamiltonian can include mechanical, thermal, electrical (charge), light, sound, and/or nuclear.
Kinetic Energy represents the energy associated with motion. 
Potential Energy represents the energy that is associated with the position or configuration of the system.

Competitive Architecture
Competitive architecture refers to a systems design where multiple entities or systems vie for limited resources, creating a scenario where the gain of one directly results in the loss of another. Here are some key characteristics:
1. Resource Sharing: Systems share a finite pool of resources, such as bandwidth, processing power, or data.
2. Zero-Sum Dynamics: The total amount of resource or utility remains constant. Any benefit gained by one system (e.g., increased performance or access) results in an equivalent detriment to another.
3. Interdependence: The performance and success of each system depend on the actions of the others, leading to strategic interactions.
4. Conflict and Strategy: Systems must develop strategies to optimize their own performance while anticipating the actions of competitors, leading to competitive behaviors.

Feedback Control
Feedback control systems are essential in various engineering and control applications to regulate the behavior of dynamic systems. These systems continuously monitor the output of a process and compare it to a desired reference value to make real-time adjustments to ensure that the output stays close to the desired value. 

Error correction is a key component of feedback control systems, as it involves determining the difference between the desired setpoint and the actual output of the system and taking corrective actions to minimize this error.
Components: A feedback control system typically consists of four main components: the system itself, a sensor to measure its output, a controller to process its sensor data and determine the corrective action, an actuator to adjust it based on the controller's output. The controller continuously adjusts the actuator based on the difference between the desired setpoint and the actual output.
Applications: Feedback control systems are widely used in processes to regulate variables including temperature, pressure, and flow rate. By continuously monitoring and adjusting the system based on feedback, these systems can minimize errors (or undesired states) and ensure that the output closely matches the desired setpoint.

Commandeering

Commandeering typically refers to the act of seizing control of something, such as a vehicle or system. This can work to affect the following applications:
1. Quantum thermodynamics: The manipulation and control of heat and energy at the quantum level.
2. Quantum pumps: Control the flow of quantum particles and energy.
3. Quantum materials: Quantum materials exhibit unique quantum properties such as superconductivity and topological insulators.
4. Quantum information processing: Leveraging information processing techniques to optimize heat management and energy transfer processes at the quantum level.
5. Quantum heat engines: Quantum heat engines convert thermal energy into useful work.

Quantum Spin Systems
A quantum spin system is a physical system composed of quantum-mechanical spins which have applications in quantum information processing and quantum simulation. Important components of a quantum spin system include:
1. Spin: Spintronics takes advantage of an intrinsic property called "spin" which can be thought of as intrinsic angular momentum. (Angular momentum is used principally to describe motion and behavior.)
2. Quantum Spin Hamiltonian: The spin system is described (set) by a Hamiltonian (a unit of potential and kinetic energy) that includes terms representing (~governing) interactions between spins, external magnetic fields, spin-orbit coupling (the linking of intrinsic spin with orbital motion around a center), and other energy contributions. The Hamiltonian typically involves operators corresponding to the projections of spin angular momentum along different axes (positions, directions, and measurements).
3. Quantum Spin Models: Theoretical models simplify interactions between spins.
4. Quantum Entanglement: The quantum states of two or more qubits are correlated in such a way that the state of one is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. Quantum spin systems exhibit entanglement between spins where the quantum states of individual spins are correlated.  Quantum heat sources leverage entanglement to transfer and manipulate thermal energy in novel ways.

1. Denial-of-Service: One of the most common uses of botnets is to launch DDoS attacks. In a DDoS attack, the infected devices to flood a target system with an overwhelming amount of traffic, causing it to become inaccessible. Distractions in the system can be created to obfuscate other processes.
2. Data theft and exfiltration: Botnets can be used to steal information from infected systems. 
3. Cryptojacking: Some botnets are used for cryptojacking, which involves using the computing resources of infected systems to mine resources without the users' knowledge or consent. By harnessing the combined processing power of the botnet, attackers can generate profits by mining at the expense of the infected system's performance and energy consumption.

Reading and Writing with Magnetic Tunnel Junctions

Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key components of spintronics that are used for both reading and writing information. When it comes to reading and writing information in quantum systems, quantum information is typically encoded in qubits. Quantum state manipulation, measurement, and entanglement play key roles in reading and writing information in quantum systems. Quantum circuits and algorithms are used to perform operations on qubits to process information. Here's how they are used:
1. Reading: MTJs are commonly used as magnetic sensors, where the resistance of the junction depends on the relative alignment of the magnetizations of two layers. The state of a memory cell can be determined by measuring the resistance of the magnetic tunnel junction.
2. Writing: Writing data to MTJs involves manipulating the magnetization of one of the layers to change the resistance state of the junction. This is achieved using various methods, including spin-transfer torque and spin-orbit torque. In spin-transfer torque, a spin-polarized current is passed through the MTJ to exert a torque on the magnetization, flipping it to the desired state.
Domain Wall Devices: Domain walls are boundaries between regions with different magnetic orientations. Domain wall devices utilize these boundaries for various purposes. By manipulating the position and movement of domain walls, these devices can be used for information storage, logic operations, and signal processing.
Spin Valves: Spin valves are devices which consist of two layers through which the magnetic resistance of a device changes based on the relative alignment of magnetic moments. One layer is pinned while the other is free to switch its magnetization direction.

Heat Transfer
Heat transfer is described as the flow of energy between two systems due to a temperature difference. In quantum thermodynamics, heat transfer can involve exchanges of energy at the quantum level, where energy levels are quantized as quantum states.

Heating
Thermal heating is the process of increasing the temperature of an object or a space by transferring heat energy to it. Given a hot object and a cold object, higher internal energy will naturally cause heat to flow from the hot object to the cold object until they reach thermal equilibrium.

Cooling
Thermal cooling is the process of decreasing the temperature of an object or a space by removing heat energy from it.

Quantum Thermal Sources
Quantum energy is generated or extracted from a quantum thermal source using quantum effects such as superposition and entanglement. 
1. Quantum Coherence: Quantum thermal sources utilize coherence, which is the ability of a quantum system to exist in a superposition of states.
2. Quantum Entanglement: The quantum states of two or more qubits are correlated in such a way that the state of one is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. Quantum thermal sources leverage entanglement to transfer and manipulate thermal energy in novel ways.
3. Quantum Fluctuations: Quantum systems are subject to inherent fluctuations that can be harnessed in a quantum thermal source to extract useful work from thermal energy reservoirs.

Quantum Links: Quantum links are the physical or virtual channels through which quantum information is transmitted between nodes.
Quantum Nodes: Quantum communication networks consist of nodes that are capable of generating, manipulating, and measuring quantum states. These nodes can include quantum computers, quantum memories, and other devices that are interconnected to form the network.

Pressure

Pressure is a fundamental physical quantity that is defined as force per unit area exerted on a surface.
Pressure plays a crucial role in the operation of heat engines, as it affects the volume of the working fluid and the efficiency of the engine. The engine is designed to convert a form of energy into motion or useful work.

Pressure changes in a heat engine occur as the working fluid expands and contracts during the different stages of the thermodynamic cycle.

Power Amplifiers
Power amplifiers increase the power of a signal and can be used in applications such as frequency transmitters where a signal needs to be boosted to a level sufficient to deliver power to the connected system. Frequency transmitters produce electromagnetic signals for communication, broadcasting, or other purposes.
Orientation: The orientation of the heat sink and the system can affect connective heat transfer and flow. Optimizing the orientation can help reduce resistance.
Mounting Pressure: Proper mounting pressure is essential to ensure good thermal contact between the heat sink and the system. Insufficient pressure can result in reduced heat transfer efficiency and increased thermal resistance.
Base Thickness: Thicker bases lessen thermal resistance by providing better thermal conductivity paths.

Positive Pressure: This occurs when a force is applied to push a substance outwards.
Negative Pressure: This is often associated with suction, where the pressure within a closed space is lower than the pressure outside, causing a substance to be drawn in. Suction works typically by creating a partial vacuum. Suction is the force that causes a fluid to be drawn into an empty space or vacuum. 

Quantum Heat Sinks
Heat sinks are passive heat exchangers / cooling devices designed to dissipate heat away from heat sources. It is (used) to absorb and dissipate heat generated by a system to help maintain or affect temperatures. The primary function of the heat sink is to absorb and dissipate heat generated by a system to the surrounding environment.
A. Contact Area: The contact area refers to where the heat sink makes direct contact with the component it is cooling. A larger contact area between the heat sink and component or system allows for more efficient heat transfer.
B. Cooling Medium: The cooling medium is the substance (fluid) or material used to absorb and carry away the heat from the heat sink and carrying it away to a heat exchanger.
C. Heat Exchanger: A heat exchanger is a device designed to facilitate the exchange of heat between fluids at different temperatures. By using a heat exchanger, heat can be transferred from a hot fluid to a cooler fluid without the two fluids mixing.
Heat sinks contain channels that increase the contact area with the cooling medium and promote heat transfer. (through training)

Quantum Heat Pumps
Quantum heat pumps are designed to move heat from a colder area to a warmer area, against the natural flow of heat.
Quantum heat pumps leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and coherence to exercise influence over heat transfer processes at the quantum level, manipulating quantum states and interactions.

Quantum superposition for stealth:
1. Delayed activation: Malicious materials could be designed to remain dormant in a superposition state until triggered by a specific quantum signal or condition. Phase Change Materials are substances that absorb and release thermal energy during phase transitions. Different PCMs are designed to work within specific temperature ranges. Integrating layers of PCMs with different activation points can create a thermal management system that reacts to varying conditions.
2. Quantum decoherence: Botnet operators need to account for decoherence effects to ensure the stability and reliability of quantum-based malware. While superposition can provide advantages for stealth, quantum decoherence is a phenomenon that can disrupt superposition states and cause quantum systems to collapse into classical states. 

Quantum Heat Engines
Quantum heat engines are designed to utilize thermal energy from a heat source and convert thermal fluctuations into useful work extraction gained by quantum effects including superposition and entanglement. Key characteristics and functions include:
1. Heat input
The heat engines receive heat from a high-temperature reservoir.
2. Work output
The engine converts some of the input heat into mechanical work.
3. Heat rejection
The engine releases the remaining heat into a lower-temperature reservoir, completing the thermodynamic cycle.

Quantum Heat Engine Operation
Here is a simplified explanation of the operation of a quantum heat engine:
1. Initialization
The quantum heat engine starts with a quantum system in a specific initial state.
2. Energy input (Heat absorption)
The quantum system interacts with a hot reservoir, absorbing energy as heat. The quantum system undergoes a unitary evolution that involves quantum superposition and entanglement. A unitary evolution is how the state of a quantum system evolves over time.
3. Processing
The quantum system is manipulated through a series of quantum operations. These operations may include applying quantum gates, changing the system's Hamiltonian, or exploiting coherence to drive the system to a desired state.
4. Energy output (Heat dissipation)
After work extraction, the quantum system releases excess energy into a cold reservoir. This step also involves dissipating heat to the environment. 
This energy can be integrated into systems to leverage the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations and simulations.
Quantum annealing: Quantum annealing is a quantum computing technique that explores energy transfer pathways to improve efficiency. One of the primary objectives of quantum annealing is to improve ductility. Ductility is a property of materials that describes the extent to which a material can deform without breaking under tensile stress before fracturing. Materials that are highly ductile can undergo significant deformation before failure. 

Quantum Entanglement and Non-linear Transformations:
Entanglement can lead to non-linear transformations between the states of entangled particles or quanta. The correlations between entangled particles can exhibit non-local and non-linear behavior that cannot be explained by classical physics.
Phase Transitions: Non-linear transformations can also arise in the context of quantum phase transitons, where the behavior of a quantum system undergoes a sudden change due to changes in parameters such as temperature or magnetic field.

Communication Channels

Quantum communication channels refer to the physical or virtual pathways through which quantum information is transmitted between different parties in a quantum communication system. Here are some key aspects of quantum communication channels:
1. Quantum Entanglement: Quantum entanglement is a fundamental property of quantum mechanics where two or more quantum particles, or quanta, become correlated in such a way that the state of one is dependent on the state of another. Quantum Entanglement can be used to establish quantum communication channels.
2. Quantum Teleportation: Quantum teleportation allows the transfer of quantum information from one quantum system to another. By utilizing entanglement and classical communication, quantum teleportation enables the transmission of quantum states between distant locations.
Routing and Switching: Quantum communication networks require specialized routing and switching mechanisms to efficiently route quantum information between nodes. Quantum routers and switches are designed to handle quantum states and ensure the secure and reliable transmission of quantum information within the network.
3. Quantum Error Correction: Quantum communication channels are susceptible to noise that can degrade the "fidelity" of transmitted quantum information. Error correction is used to protect quantum information against errors that occur during transmission over quantum channels.
